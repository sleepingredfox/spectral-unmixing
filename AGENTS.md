Guidance for coding agents working in this repository.

## Project overview

This is a Python desktop application for biomedical hyperspectral spectral unmixing. It loads image cubes, computes reflectance and optical density, builds spectral model matrices from LED/chromophore/pathlength CSVs, solves chromophore concentration maps, and displays/exports results through a PySide6 GUI.

PySide6 is the only supported UI for release `0.2.2+`; do not reintroduce the removed tkinter/legacy fallback.

## Important paths

- `app/main.py` — application entry point; launches the Qt UI.
- `app/core/io.py` — root/data folder validation, image loading, chromophore/LED/pathlength CSV loading.
- `app/core/processing.py` — reflectance/OD math, overlap and absorption matrices, LS/NNLS/`mu_a`/iterative solvers, diagnostics.
- `app/core/export.py` — saves maps, arrays, and metadata; uses Matplotlib `Agg` backend.
- `app/gui_qt/main_window.py` — main PySide6 window, pipeline adapter, toolbar/sidebar/tabs, stable object-name constants used by tests.
- `app/gui_qt/worker.py` — `QObject` worker and signals for background pipeline execution.
- `app/gui_qt/panels/`, `app/gui_qt/widgets/`, `app/gui_qt/mpl/` — Qt panels, widgets, and Matplotlib canvas helpers.
- `data/` — default spectral data (`leds_emission.csv`, `penetration_depth_digitized.csv`, `chromophores/*.csv`).
- `tests/` — mixed `unittest` and `pytest` suite, including many Qt/headless tests.
- `features/` — feature notes, parity evidence, and implementation plans; inspect relevant files before changing related behavior.
- `.github/workflows/build-windows.yml` and `spectral-unmixing.spec` — Windows PyInstaller release build.

Ignore generated/cache content such as `__pycache__/`, `.pytest_cache/`, `.venv/`, `.DS_Store`, and ignored large sample-data folders.

## Environment and commands

Use the project virtual environment when present:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
.venv/bin/python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Useful development extras for the full test suite may be needed in a fresh env:

```bash
.venv/bin/python -m pip install pytest pytest-qt pyinstaller
```

Run the app:

```bash
.venv/bin/python app/main.py
# or
.venv/bin/python -m app.main
# or, if .venv exists
./run.sh
```

Run tests headlessly, especially before/after GUI changes:

```bash
QT_QPA_PLATFORM=offscreen .venv/bin/python -m pytest -q tests
```

Targeted tests for common edit areas:

```bash
.venv/bin/python -m pytest -q tests/test_data_folder_selection.py
.venv/bin/python -m pytest -q tests/test_processing_fixed_scattering.py
.venv/bin/python -m pytest -q tests/test_background_consistency.py
QT_QPA_PLATFORM=offscreen .venv/bin/python -m pytest -q tests/test_gui_qt_smoke.py tests/test_main_window.py
```

The tests include both `unittest` and `pytest` styles; `pytest` can run both. Some Qt tests create a `QApplication` at import time, so set `QT_QPA_PLATFORM=offscreen` before invoking tests in headless environments.

Build the Windows executable locally only when needed:

```bash
pyinstaller spectral-unmixing.spec --clean --noconfirm
```

If adding new import-only modules used at runtime by the packaged app, update `spectral-unmixing.spec` hidden imports as needed.

## Data and pipeline assumptions

A processing root folder contains sample subfolders plus required `ref/` and `dark_ref/` folders. Image filenames must start with the wavelength prefix, e.g. `450nm...`; wavelengths are parsed as integers and sorted.

A spectral data folder must contain:

```text
leds_emission.csv
penetration_depth*.csv
chromophores/*.csv
```

`io._find_penetration_depth_file()` intentionally prefers `penetration_depth_digitized.csv`, then falls back to the lexicographically first `penetration_depth*.csv`. Preserve this deterministic behavior.

Supported image loading:

- JPEG/PNG and similar PIL-readable files via `PIL.Image`.
- `.dng` via `rawpy`; keep the graceful `ImportError` when `rawpy` is unavailable.

The core pipeline in `SpectralUnmixingMainWindow._make_pipeline_adapter()` loads refs once, then processes each sample into a result payload. Keep payload keys stable (`sample_cube`, `reflectance`, `od_cube`, `concentrations`, `fitted_od`, `rmse_map`, `derived`, `derived_maps`, `diagnostics`, `A`, `chromophore_names`, solver/config keys) because panels and tests consume them.

## Solver/model notes

Supported solver methods are `ls`, `nnls`, `mu_a`, and `iterative`.

- `ls` and `nnls` use the overlap matrix from LED emission, chromophore spectra, and penetration depth.
- `mu_a` uses the band-averaged absorption matrix plus fixed-scattering profile and does not support background.
- `iterative` uses NNLS with an iteratively updated effective pathlength and may return fallback metadata in `solver_info`.
- Background parameters are supported for LS/NNLS/iterative only. UI selection uses `Background`; export metadata/maps use `background`.
- Derived maps `THb` and `StO2` are produced only when chromophore names include exactly `HbO2` and `Hb`.

Keep validation logic in `app/core/processing.py` as the source of truth for background, scattering, and iterative solver parameters. Route UI/API inputs through those validators instead of duplicating constraints.

## Qt GUI conventions

- Preserve deferred PySide6 imports where modules are intended to be import-safe.
- Keep stable object-name constants in `app/gui_qt/main_window.py`; tests find widgets by these names.
- Do not mutate Qt widgets from worker/background code. `app/gui_qt/worker.py` should communicate through signals, and UI updates should happen in main-window slots.
- Reuse existing panel/widget modules for UI changes rather than adding large logic blocks to tests or the entry point.
- Be careful with `QApplication` singletons in tests; create one only if `QApplication.instance()` is `None`.
- For Matplotlib in GUI code, respect the existing Qt canvas helpers; for export code, keep the non-interactive `Agg` backend.

## Coding and testing guidance

- Prefer small, targeted edits and keep public function signatures stable unless tests/docs are updated together.
- Preserve deterministic ordering: sorted folders/files, sorted chromophore CSV loading, sorted wavelengths.
- Use explicit validation errors for bad input files, ragged CSV rows, non-numeric CSV values, and shape mismatches.
- Keep numerical code finite-safe (`np.isfinite`, clipping, `nan_to_num`) where existing code already hardens behavior.
- Avoid committing generated outputs, caches, virtual environments, local sample datasets, or binary test artifacts.
- When changing defaults or release behavior, update both `README.md` and `pyproject.toml` if version/user-facing instructions change.
- After core math changes, run focused core tests plus at least one GUI smoke test to catch payload/contract regressions.
